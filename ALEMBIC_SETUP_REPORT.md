# Alembic Migrations Setup Report

## Summary

Alembic migrations are now properly configured and working for the project. The database schema is synchronized with the current models.

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Verified Alembic Configuration
- `alembic.ini` - properly configured
- `alembic/env.py` - correctly imports all models via `app.db.base`
- Database URL is dynamically loaded from settings

### 2. ✅ Created New Migration
- Generated migration: `0c345ce07ccf_sync_models_with_database`
- The migration was empty (only `pass` statements), indicating the database is already in sync

### 3. ✅ Applied Migration
- Successfully upgraded database to latest migration
- Current migration: `0c345ce07ccf (head)`

### 4. ✅ Verified Migration History
```
0c345ce07ccf (head) - Sync models with database
edcb206e1cc2        - Add shops table for multi-tenancy  
0a0c151423bb        - Create all tables including customer_addresses
```

### 5. ✅ Confirmed Database Tables
All 15 tables are present in the database:
- alembic_version (migration tracking)
- company_settings
- customer_addresses
- customer_important_dates
- customers
- deliveries
- delivery_positions
- florist_tasks
- order_items
- orders
- product_images
- products
- shops
- task_items
- warehouse_items

## How to Use Alembic

### Create a new migration:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Check current status:
```bash
alembic current
alembic history
```

### Rollback:
```bash
alembic downgrade -1  # Go back one migration
```

## Railway Deployment

The migrations are already configured to work with Railway:
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs migrations on startup
- Falls back to `create_missing_tables.py` if migrations fail
- Works with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (production)

## Testing

Created `test_alembic.py` script that verifies:
- Current migration status
- Migration history
- Database table existence
- Alembic version tracking

## Result

✅ **Alembic is fully configured and operational!**
- All models are tracked
- Database is up to date
- Ready for future schema changes
- Production-ready for Railway deployment
