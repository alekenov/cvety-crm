# JWT Authentication Fix Report

## Summary

JWT authentication has been partially implemented for protected endpoints. The system now requires authentication tokens for accessing protected routes.

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Auth Check Functions Created
- `get_current_shop()` - Validates JWT token and returns authenticated shop
- `get_optional_current_shop()` - Optional auth check for mixed access endpoints
- Both functions properly validate JWT tokens and check shop status

### 2. ✅ Protected Endpoints Updated
- **Orders API** (`/api/orders/`) - Now requires JWT authentication
- **Customers API** (`/api/customers/`) - Now requires JWT authentication  
- **Warehouse API** (`/api/warehouse/`) - Partially updated

### 3. ✅ Authentication Testing
- Created `test_auth.py` script to verify authentication
- Confirmed that endpoints return 403 Forbidden without valid tokens
- Invalid tokens are properly rejected with 401 Unauthorized

## Current Status

### Working:
- JWT token validation logic ✅
- Auth dependency injection ✅
- Token generation via OTP ✅
- Protected routes reject unauthorized access ✅

### Limitations:
- **No Multi-tenancy**: Models don't have `shop_id` field, so data isn't filtered by shop
- **Partial Implementation**: Only some endpoints have been updated
- **403 vs 401**: Some endpoints return 403 instead of standard 401

## How Authentication Works

1. **Request OTP**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/auth/request-otp
   {"phone": "+77001234567"}
   ```

2. **Verify OTP and Get Token**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/auth/verify-otp
   {"phone": "+77001234567", "otp_code": "123456"}
   
   Response:
   {"access_token": "eyJ...", "token_type": "bearer"}
   ```

3. **Use Token for Protected Endpoints**:
   ```bash
   GET /api/orders/
   Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
   ```

## Remaining Work

### High Priority:
1. Add auth check to remaining endpoints:
   - `/api/products/`
   - `/api/production/`
   - `/api/settings/`

2. Standardize error responses (401 instead of 403)

3. Add shop_id to all models for proper multi-tenancy

### Medium Priority:
1. Implement token refresh mechanism
2. Add role-based access control
3. Add API documentation for auth endpoints

## Testing

Run the auth test script:
```bash
python3 test_auth.py
```

Expected output:
- Without token: 403 Forbidden ✅
- With invalid token: 401 Unauthorized ✅
- Protected endpoints require auth ✅

## Notes

- The system is more secure now but not fully multi-tenant
- Each shop gets a JWT token but data isn't filtered by shop yet
- This is a temporary solution until proper multi-tenancy is implemented
