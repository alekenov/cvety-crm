# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DateTime Timezone Comparison Error
**Problem**: The application was comparing timezone-naive datetimes with timezone-aware datetimes, causing TypeErrors.

**Solution**: Updated all `datetime.utcnow()` calls to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to ensure timezone-aware comparisons.

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/app/models/production.py` - Fixed `is_overdue` property
- `/backend/app/crud/florist_task.py` - Fixed all datetime operations
- `/backend/app/crud/task_item.py` - Fixed `completed_at` assignment
- `/backend/app/services/task_queue.py` - Fixed datetime comparisons

### 2. Products API Endpoint Format
**Problem**: The `/api/products` endpoint was returning a list instead of the expected `{items: [], total: number}` format.

**Solution**: Updated the endpoint to return the correct format.

**Files Modified**:
- `/backend/app/api/endpoints/products.py` - Updated response format

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: timezone-aware datetime comparisons and products API format"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically deploy** the changes from your main branch

3. **Monitor the deployment** at Railway dashboard

4. **Verify the fixes**:
   - Check that `/api/production/queue/stats` no longer returns 500 errors
   - Verify that `/api/products` returns the correct format
   - Test that production tasks work correctly

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (automatically provided by Railway)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Your secret key for JWT
- `PORT` - Automatically set by Railway
- `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` - Set to your frontend URL

## Testing the Fixes

After deployment, test these endpoints:
```bash
# Test production queue stats
curl https://cvety-kz-production.up.railway.app/api/production/queue/stats

# Test products endpoint
curl https://cvety-kz-production.up.railway.app/api/products

# Test production tasks
curl https://cvety-kz-production.up.railway.app/api/production/tasks
```

## Additional Notes

- The database tables are automatically created on startup via Alembic migrations
- All datetime values are now stored and compared as UTC timezone-aware
- The API follows consistent response formats across all endpoints
